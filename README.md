# modular_hangman
Modularized Hangman in Node through command line using NPM Inquirer Package.

## Packages Used: 
* __Inquirer__ to Get User Input
* __Chalk Used__ for colors in the command line. 

## To Run App: 
* Type __npm i__ or __npm install__ to install the necessarry NPM packages. 
* Type __node main.js__ To start the App. 

## Notes
* Some game words which are all movie titles include punctuation. The user will have to guess those. 
* All spaces will be provided so space as user input is not necessary. If you guess a space it will be correct though.
* Have gotten some bugs like .length is not defined on occassion but most times errors don't appear.
* Press control c in the command line if errors occur and restart the app to play again.
